              "2118   I found out that my card was stolen when reviewing the statement. I made a call to bank to stop and ask for a replacement. This happened around an hour after that charge was done ( which should fall within 24 hours, and showing my due diligent reviewing my statement on a daily basis ). \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter informing me that the investigation has been done and that I end up being responsible for these two unauthorized charges because they used the card, {$98.00}, and {$61.00} because I \" benefit from these charges '' ( what is this?! ). The letter mentioned calling the number if I have any more questions. I called the number XXXX only to get an answering machine said that it can not process any calls, and to send the email to XXXX. \\n\\nI then send an email to them as per the phone message on XX/XX/XXXX. I have not received any response from them. I send another follow-up email on XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nAt the same time, I have been calling them with the phone number on my card. It was mentioned that they did attempt to contact me in XXXX. I informed them that I am XXXX, and use XXXX XXXX XXXX. They have been calling me on my mobile phone number ( using for texting only ) and that I am unable to answer it. I gave them my phone number where they can connect me through XXXX XXXX XXXX ( where an interpreter will be present to interpret the calls between both parties ). Here are the dates of when I called them : XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX As you can see above, I have too many different numbers to call and trying to figure out why I am responsible for these charges, and that it is not done by me. I have no success in getting this information, and I have repeatedly mentioned that I am XXXX, that they need to call me the phone number with an interpreter ( which I repeatedly gave them ). Apparently it fell on their deaf ears. \\n\\nI have filed two formal complaints, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, and gave the corporate a chance to resolve my complaint. As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, I got a phone call on my mobile phone. I called back on the phone number ( XXXX ) and only got the answering machine with no options to connect me to their people. I have to call the number on the back of the card to figure out, but they do not have the correct privilege or access to assist me in this. \\n\\nThis is a Chase Sapphire Reserve account, which I am actually paying an annual fee for it, and I do not feel like I'm being treated with respect. In fact, my other credit cards where it doesn't have an annual fee, actually, treat me better! \\n\\nFor what is worth, their website even mentioned that the card come with \" Zero Liability Protection '' ( https : //www.chase.comXXXXcard-benefits/sapphirereserve/account-protection ), it doesnt even work with me.   \n",
              "10250  XX/XX/XXXX I entered into a repayment plan on a second mortgage requiring me to make an initial payment of {$1100.00} and remaining payments of {$710.00} between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Although I submitted each payment via Chase Bank cashier 's check on time, Chase began denying my payments just before the end of the repayment agreement. Chase Bank returned the payment for XXXX XXXX claiming the payment plan was rendered inactive on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX due to missed payments for the months of XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. The payments for these months were processed and sent by Chase employee, XXXX XXXX - Relationship Banker XXXX ID : XXXX. Apparently, Chase Bank had credited these payments to another account but with the assistance of Branch Manager- XXXX XXXX , we were able to correct this error and have the payments allocated and posted to the correct account. \\nBranch Manager, XXXX XXXX as well as myself, expected the account to be returned to good standing after confirming the payments were sent to and received by Chase Bank, as well as these payments being properly posted to the account. \\nOn XXXX XXXX, XXXX I received a letter from Chase Bank ( dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) stating that my repayment plan could not be reinstated because, although XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX payments were received and posted to my account, the payment for XXXX XXXX was missed and this would have also resulted in the cancellation of the repayment plan. Chase Bank went on to send a copy of my payment history and according to their own records the XXXX XXXX payment was received and posted to my account as XXXX-FORCE REG PMT INTEREST. \\nAt this point, with all the investigating and assistance from both XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, there is no question that all payments were sent to and received by Chase Bank and I have in no way defaulted on the contractual agreement. This latest communication from Chase Bank, continuing to reject the legally binding contract entered into on XX/XX/XXXX, for no justifiable reason, is proof of fraud ( A False Representation Of A Matter Of Fact ) on behalf of Chase Bank. Chase Bank has met all elements considered when determining actual fraud : 1 ) Made a false statement of a material fact 2 ) Completely aware that the statement is false 3 ) Clear and unquestionable intent to deceive 4 ) Justifiable reliance by victim on the statement made by Chase Bank 5 ) Financial injury caused by Chase Bank 6 ) Communication by U.S. Mail constitutes Mail Fraud I am requesting the CFPB investigate these allegations and bring this to the attention of the Federal Authorities. Chase Bank has made every possible attempt to default on the contract under false pretenses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

              "14842  JP Morgan Chase made a hard inquiry on my credit on XXXX XXXX, 2016 without my authorization to do so. Upon notification of the change on my credit I investigated the matter and notified JP Morgan Chase. They sent me a letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2016 stating that they contacted XXXX, XXXX and XXXX and asked them to remove the inquiry from my credit profile. On XXXX XXXX, 2016 the inquiries was still not removed from my profile. I contacted the credit agencies who then informed me that JP Morgan Chase never contacted them and therefore the hard inquiry is still on my credit profile. I contaced JP Morgan Chase again and then proceeded to dispute the hard inquiry with all the credit agencies. I received a letter from JP Morgan Chase dated XXXX XXXX, 2016 which is identical to the first letter they sent which says that they confirm having contacted the credit agencies and asked them to remove the inquiries from my credit profile. This has still not been done and it is likely to affect a life-important transaction I am about to make with my husband. This is definitely not acceptable and this matter must be investigated by a higher authority since I am unable to do anything more than I already have. Both letters referenced above is attached hereto. \\nSincerely, XXXX                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

Chase Bank went on to send a copy of my payment history and according to their own records the XXXX XXXX payment was received and posted to my account as XXXX-FORCE REG PMT INTEREST. \\nAt this point, with all the investigating and assistance from both XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, there is no question that all payments were sent to and received by Chase Bank and I have in no way defaulted on the contractual agreement. This latest communication from Chase Bank, continuing to reject the legally binding contract entered into on XX/XX/XXXX, for no justifiable reason, is proof of fraud ( A False Representation Of A Matter Of Fact ) on behalf of Chase Bank. Chase Bank has met all elements considered when determining actual fraud : 1 ) Made a false statement of a material fact 2 ) Completely aware that the statement is false 3 ) Clear and unquestionable intent to deceive 4 ) Justifiable reliance by victim on the statement made by Chase Bank 5 ) Financial injury caused by Chase Bank 6 ) Communication by U.S. Mail constitutes Mail Fraud I am requesting the CFPB investigate these allegations and bring this to the attention of the Federal Authorities.

              "512    I have made a reservation with XXXX for one day stay at The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   that I later needed to cancel. Upon cancellation I have received an email from XXXX stating that if my cancellation occurred less than 5 days prior to arrival I would be charged {$160.00}. Instead of the correct amount The XXXX XXXX charged my Chase card {$460.00}. I disputed the charges with Chase and a month later received a USPS letter stating that my dispute has been closed and transaction was determined to be valid. I called chase and was told that The XXXX XXXX has submitted printouts from a website I have never seen stating what their cancellation charges would be. I insisted in reopening the dispute and once again, submitted a cancellation email from XXXX stating that my cancellation fees would be {$160.00}. A month passed by again and I once again received a USPS letter stating that my dispute was denied. This happened several times without any explanation of any kind. Chase kept saying that The XXXX XXXX submitted a web site printout and was not paying attention to anything I was sending in. When I received a third denial letter dated XX/XX/19 I called Chase again and was told that even thou they now do see that my cancellation fee should have been {$160.00} and not {$460.00} there is nothing they can do because my dispute time frame has passed and hence charge is deemed to be valid. \\nI feel that since I filed the dispute within the allowed time frame and provided all support documentation I should not be paying for Chase incompetence and refusal to even look at the documentation I was sending in. \\nChase caused time to lapse, not me. I provided all documentation since the day I filed the dispute. Why am I responsible for incorrect charges that Chase failed to properly dispute with a merchant?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
              "19965  I attempted to send a XXXX payment to my sister for {$290.00} though my online banking account with Chase, something I have done numerous times before, though not to this particular recipient. The next day I checked my email and had a message from Chase saying there was an important message regarding my transfer, which had been cancelled, and that I should login to my online account to read the details in my Message Center. Upon trying to log in, I received a screen telling me my online access had been blocked, due to \" suspicious activity '' on my account. I called the number and after speaking with the customer service agent I was told the only way to unblock my online access was to go to a Chase branch in person and present my ID. The problem being I am XXXX overseas, serving in the XXXX XXXX XXXX and unable to appear in person. I was not offered any other means of authentication. I requested escalation several times and eventually spoke with the Executive office and filed a complaint. This resulted in a case being opened and assigned to an \" investigator '' who was supposed to help identify other means for me to verify my account. I offered to send notarized IS 's plus a notarized letter from the Ambassador and was told no, that would not be accepted. I offered to go to XXXX, the only U bank here in XXXX for verification and was again told no. I was literally given no options for verification other than the in-person at a branch option. I called back the next day, and continued to be told the only way to unlock my access would be to come into a branch in person. I can only access my bank account online here in XXXX, so without access I am unable to pay my bills, transfer money to my children, verify my deposits and transactions, etc. It was absurd that the bank would not prove another means of verifying myself, other than to come into a branch physically myself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
              "462    A loan request ( refinance ) was done XX/XX/2019. It was denied. \\nVerbally, a representative took the complaint regarding the extra interest. Chase refused to refinance and never addressed that. Chase sent papers for \" voluntarily surrendering '' the vehicle. Using Chases secure messaging a request was made asking that Chase \" waive the defiency ''. This was also denied. When the vehicle was purchased I was told I could refinance in 6 months. That was not true.There were several misconceptions. \\n\\nDuring this time Chase phoned no less than 8 times, which would have been great had I known it was Chase. The calls were all toll free and I thought they were robotic calls trying to get money. Also, I did not know how to retrieve the voice mail. My wife got them all today Monday XX/XX/2019. When I became ill my wife stopped working to care for my needs. So the extra income we had was gone. A lower interest rate would have really helped during this difficult time. It is emotionally and financially draining. \\n\\nLate fees were applied more than I can remember. No matter if the payment was on the XXXX or XXXX day of the month, there was a late charge. That was never addressed. Verbally, Chase said \" payment isn't late till the end of the month ''. That wasn't true. This was also a hail damaged vehicle. Because of my XXXX I couldn't see all the damage on the top of the care. \\nBelow is what I believe has happened with me ; Article by XXXX XXXX \" The editorial page of the XXXX XXXX XXXX recently weighed in on an important but underappreciated aspect of the financial crisis : The systematic targeting of communities of XXXX for risky and unfair loans. As the XXXX put it : Pricing discrimination illegally charging minority customers more for loans and other services than similarly qualified XXXX are charged is a longstanding problem? '' After the fact of dealing with Chase, several articles have stated that higher interest rate loans are given because they know you will default because rates are too high to be paid back. Shame on Chase. \\nBeing an older person I thought I would be treated fairly and without partiality.

              "17222  On XX/XX/2016 my payment to Chase Bank 's Credit Card department was posted to my checking account. This transaction typically takes 2 to 3 days to post on Chase Bank 's side. For some reason beyond my control, this transaction did n't post on their system until XX/XX/2016. Chase assessed a late fee, which increased my minimum payment. In XX/XX/XXXX, I made the same payment as in XX/XX/XXXX not knowing anything had changed. Chase assessed an additional late fee. In XX/XX/XXXX I contacted them and disputed the charge. I 'm well within the 60 day window for such issues. They agreed to waive the late fees. In XX/XX/XXXX, I was assessed another late fee for not making my minimum payment ( which I did ) because Chase only waived XXXX of the XXXX late fees. Thus my account was not made whole and I continued to be erroneously deemed 'delinquent ' in my payments. I called yet again and they were unwilling to live up to their previous agreement and insisted on continuing to charge me multiple late fees. I am paying off my balance ( minus these erroneous fees ) and closing this account immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

Also, I have not heard from her whether the funds have been applied as indicated in their email. \\nThis complaint is now on its third month without any resolution because Chase is not doing its best to have the funds transferred to the recipient bank. \\nThe Chase agent has just given me a run around about the complaint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
              "13099  I sent an email to XXXXXXXXXXXX for home mortgage refinance on XXXX and they assigned XXXX XXXX XXXX to me. XXXX and I had the first phone conversation on XXXX on phone during which a credit inquiry was executed in order to estimate the rate. It turned out to be more than 3.0 % which was very close to my previous rate ( 3.25 % ). Therefore I did n't want to take that rate and said I needed to discuss with my family. XXXX promised that I did n't have to make a decision immediately it and can officially proceeded/denied until Monday ( XXXX ). As XXXX spoke very fast during the phone, I was afraid I may miss some points, so I asked again that if the case did n't get started without my consent on Monday. XXXX sent an email afterwards for documentations but I did n't upload anything to the system. Later I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX and visited his office on Saturday ( XXXX ). XXXX asked for the same basic information and had another inquiry for the credit. The rate was still more than 3.0 %, so I did n't move forward. \\n\\nOn Monday ( XXXX ), I sent an email to XXXX that I decided not to move forward. XXXX then asked in the email that if I would move forward if he could lower the rate XXXX which is 3.0 %? Then I asked that what was the processing fee if the rate was 3.0 %. He said it would be {$1000.00} or so. As I had no exact number of fee at that point, so I DID N'T said lock the rate in the email. Later I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX who provided a rate of 2.875 % and processing fee of {$1300.00}, so I sent to XXXX again that I was going to accept that and not move forward in Chase. Note that I did n't ask for a match, I just said stop the case. XXXX also confirmed it in the email. During the entire process, I DID N'T provide a single piece of documentation, credit card number for deposit, or sign any documentation. \\n\\nI did n't have any contact with Chase for my case afterwards until XXXX XXXX XXXX called me on XXXX. XXXX asked me that if I got the loan from any bank. I told him that I 've gotten one from credit union which was XXXX and {$1300.00}. XXXX asked me to send him the digital copy of the estimation. In the afternoon of Friday ( XXXX ), XXXX called me again and told me that he got a very good rate of XXXX and a rebate of {$600.00}. Therefore I visited his office on Saturday ( XXXX ). I provided my documentation ( XXXX ). XXXX shown me the rate on computer and printed out a few paper. I reviewed all materials, gave the consent to XXXX XXXX to move on and provided the credit card for deposit. However, the system fail to lock the rate on Saturday ( XXXX ) so I had to send the signed letter on next week to proceed. \\n\\nA few days later, XXXX told me that the rate was locked at Chase. I was very surprised at the situation as I only gave consent to locking the rate at Chase on XXXX. XXXX asked me to write a statement regarding what happened so he could forwarded it to his manager XXXX XXXX XXXX. It was very disappointed that I waited almost one month and did n't get any response from XXXX XXXX. In early XXXX, I had to call XXXX XXXX to ask the status of the application. Unfortunately, XXXX XXXX insisted that the rate was locked before without showing any evidence. He refused to resolve the issue, kicked the ball the another department. \\n\\nTill today, I still do n't get response from Chase. \\n\\nSummary : 1. I DID NOT demand to lock the rate in XXXX. \\n2. I DID NOT even know when the rate was locked and what kind of rate was locked. Please provide materials to let me know because I might be somehow misled. \\n3. I DID NOT sign any documentation to XXXX or provide any documentation to lock the rate. \\n4. I DID cease the application with XXXX in XXXX.   \n",

              "      <td>I have made a reservation with XXXX for one day stay at The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   that I later needed to cancel. Upon cancellation I have received an email from XXXX stating that if my cancellation occurred less than 5 days prior to arrival I would be charged {$160.00}. Instead of the correct amount The XXXX XXXX charged my Chase card {$460.00}. I disputed the charges with Chase and a month later received a USPS letter stating that my dispute has been closed and transaction was determined to be valid. I called chase and was told that The XXXX XXXX has submitted printouts from a website I have never seen stating what their cancellation charges would be. I insisted in reopening the dispute and once again, submitted a cancellation email from XXXX stating that my cancellation fees would be {$160.00}. A month passed by again and I once again received a USPS letter stating that my dispute was denied. This happened several times without any explanation of any kind. Chase kept saying that The XXXX XXXX submitted a web site printout and was not paying attention to anything I was sending in. When I received a third denial letter dated XX/XX/19 I called Chase again and was told that even thou they now do see that my cancellation fee should have been {$160.00} and not {$460.00} there is nothing they can do because my dispute time frame has passed and hence charge is deemed to be valid. \\nI feel that since I filed the dispute within the allowed time frame and provided all support documentation I should not be paying for Chase incompetence and refusal to even look at the documentation I was sending in. \\nChase caused time to lapse, not me. I provided all documentation since the day I filed the dispute. Why am I responsible for incorrect charges that Chase failed to properly dispute with a merchant?</td>\n",

Upon trying to log in, I received a screen telling me my online access had been blocked, due to \" suspicious activity '' on my account.

The problem being I am XXXX overseas, serving in the XXXX XXXX XXXX and unable to appear in person. I was not offered any other means of authentication. I requested escalation several times and eventually spoke with the Executive office and filed a complaint. This resulted in a case being opened and assigned to an \" investigator '' who was supposed to help identify other means for me to verify my account. I offered to send notarized IS 's plus a notarized letter from the Ambassador and was told no, that would not be accepted. I offered to go to XXXX, the only U bank here in XXXX for verification and was again told no. I was literally given no options for verification other than the in-person at a branch option. I called back the next day, and continued to be told the only way to unlock my access would be to come into a branch in person.

XXXX promised that I did n't have to make a decision immediately it and can officially proceeded/denied until Monday ( XXXX ). As XXXX spoke very fast during the phone, I was afraid I may miss some points, so I asked again that if the case did n't get started without my consent on Monday. XXXX sent an email afterwards for documentations but I did n't upload anything to the system. Later I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX and visited his office on Saturday ( XXXX ). XXXX asked for the same basic information and had another inquiry for the credit. The rate was still more than 3.0 %, so I did n't move forward. \\n\\nOn Monday ( XXXX ), I sent an email to XXXX that I decided not to move forward. XXXX then asked in the email that if I would move forward if he could lower the rate XXXX which is 3.0 %? Then I asked that what was the processing fee if the rate was 3.0 %. He said it would be {$1000.00} or so. As I had no exact number of fee at that point, so I DID N'T said lock the rate in the email. Later I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX who provided a rate of 2.875 % and processing fee of {$1300.00}, so I sent to XXXX again that I was going to accept that and not move forward in Chase. Note that I did n't ask for a match, I just said stop the case. XXXX also confirmed it in the email. During the entire process, I DID N'T provide a single piece of documentation, credit card number for deposit, or sign any documentation. \\n\\nI did n't have any contact with Chase for my case afterwards until XXXX XXXX XXXX called me on XXXX.

I was very surprised at the situation as I only gave consent to locking the rate at Chase on XXXX. XXXX asked me to write a statement regarding what happened so he could forwarded it to his manager XXXX XXXX XXXX. It was very disappointed that I waited almost one month and did n't get any response from XXXX XXXX. In early XXXX, I had to call XXXX XXXX to ask the status of the application.

              "18069  Companies involved : Chase corporate headquarters and XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nComplaint : XXXX XXXX reported a fraud to chase bank and the police department. This fraud eligibly started with a breach in an email correspondence between a vendor and us. The buyer received the products that were ordered from the vendor and we used the same email we have been corresponding with the vendor and requested bank information. A hacker intercepted the email preventing the true business/vendor from receiving the email asking for bank information. Thus, the hacker provided, what we did not know was personal bank details. An ACH payment of {$7500.00} was made on XX/XX/XXXX and addressed to a business name, XXXX, with the bank account information provided from the email. However, the account number was to a XXXX personal account, not the business we addressed it to. The ACH should not have gone through as the name did not match the name on the receiving ends account. For an ACH payment to go through, all information must match and in this case the information did not match. \\nAfter speaking with several associates form JP Morgan Chase, no one was willing to assist us with this matter. We were told we should contact the bank the money was sent to. So, we contacted XXXX, informed of the situation, and that we have a police report regarding this issue. XXXX told us that this matter must be settled between the banks and they are not permitted to assist us because we do not have an account with them. We then contacted chase corporate office who informed us they would do their best to assist. We never received a follow-up call, as we were told we would. When we called to request an update on this issue, we were transferred five times and were on the phone for 1.5hrs. Finally, we were transferred to the correct department and the woman gave us the same answer as all the other people we spoke with, I will speak to the claims department and will get back with you. We have yet to be informed of a solution. This has been an on-going process for over a month and we still have yet to have the funds returned. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I tried calling XXXX from corporate for an update, but only got her voice mail. I then called Chase branch on XXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke to XXXX who said he would speak with his branch manager XXXX, to see if there is anything he could do. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX XXXX spoke to XXXX from Chase corporate who informed me that she could not locate a reference number on this case, but she would create one ( XXXX ) and escalate this case to claims/fraud. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX transferred me to XXXX who transferred me to XXXX who transferred me to XXXX who transferred me to XXXX who transferred me to XXXX who then transferred me to XXXX . All this within an hour and a half.   \n",

              "16462  This is a follow-up on complaint XXXX regarding the closing of complaint and cfpb did n't even look into the matter regarding chase billing dispute and false statements report to credit bureaus and to CFPB. Chase stated to CFPB THAT my slate account was sold to XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX they also sent me a letter from XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX stating the same false statement and violated FCRA When they submitted false statements to XXXX  stating that the slate account could not have been sold to XXXX in XXXX cause on my XXXX report XXXX XX/XX/XXXX the slate account was not even opened until XX/XX/XXXX and closed in XX/XX/XXXX. Also I sent chase XXXX XXXX an email with my meeting with the branch manager on XX/XX/XXXX where I clearly told him to close all my accounts. So they are reporting false statements about the XXXX card XXXX XXXX sent me a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX saying that they found no evidence of me closing the account with the branch manager and he States please be advised that the account is closed XX/XX/XXXX but I did not close the account on that date but they reported it to XXXX that the account was closed at consumer request but it does n't show the account is closed it shows 150 days late payments and false credit limit of {$500.00} when it was {$4000.00}. They said my mother was added as a authorized user XX/XX/XXXX which is completely false and my mother was not even on my account. I was a authorized user on my Mother 's Chase Freedom Card but they closed that a month after she XXXX they reported it for 3 years to the credit bureaus but they stopped reporting that account. They also state she was removed from the XXXX card on XX/XX/XXXX which is completely False statement my mother XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX why did n't I have her removed then Ask them for documents I sent to Chase where I closed the account where I removed my mother from my XXXX card and if they ca n't prove what they are reporting to you and the credit bureaus with letters I sent to them on the date they claim these events took place with my signature and date then they are knowingly violating the FCRA and I am a XXXX veteran and probably violated the American with disabilities act also.

As a widow with a daughter with latent XXXX XXXX I am struggling to make my monthly payment. Can someone please explain to me why the huge almost double difference in the monthly payment amounts from XXXX branch of Chase to another? I just made my XX/XX/2016 payment and I paid from the Chase monthly statement I received showing {$440.00}. l called Chase asking for verification of the amount due and the woman I spoke to said the payment was {$800.00} plus, once again a different amount. I would appreciate any help you can give me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

              "      <td>Companies involved : Chase corporate headquarters and XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nComplaint : XXXX XXXX reported a fraud to chase bank and the police department. This fraud eligibly started with a breach in an email correspondence between a vendor and us. The buyer received the products that were ordered from the vendor and we used the same email we have been corresponding with the vendor and requested bank information. A hacker intercepted the email preventing the true business/vendor from receiving the email asking for bank information. Thus, the hacker provided, what we did not know was personal bank details. An ACH payment of {$7500.00} was made on XX/XX/XXXX and addressed to a business name, XXXX, with the bank account information provided from the email. However, the account number was to a XXXX personal account, not the business we addressed it to. The ACH should not have gone through as the name did not match the name on the receiving ends account. For an ACH payment to go through, all information must match and in this case the information did not match. \\nAfter speaking with several associates form JP Morgan Chase, no one was willing to assist us with this matter. We were told we should contact the bank the money was sent to. So, we contacted XXXX, informed of the situation, and that we have a police report regarding this issue. XXXX told us that this matter must be settled between the banks and they are not permitted to assist us because we do not have an account with them. We then contacted chase corporate office who informed us they would do their best to assist. We never received a follow-up call, as we were told we would. When we called to request an update on this issue, we were transferred five times and were on the phone for 1.5hrs. Finally, we were transferred to the correct department and the woman gave us the same answer as all the other people we spoke with, I will speak to the claims department and will get back with you. We have yet to be informed of a solution. This has been an on-going process for over a month and we still have yet to have the funds returned. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I tried calling XXXX from corporate for an update, but only got her voice mail. I then called Chase branch on XXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke to XXXX who said he would speak with his branch manager XXXX, to see if there is anything he could do. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX XXXX spoke to XXXX from Chase corporate who informed me that she could not locate a reference number on this case, but she would create one ( XXXX ) and escalate this case to claims/fraud. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX transferred me to XXXX who transferred me to XXXX who transferred me to XXXX who transferred me to XXXX who transferred me to XXXX who then transferred me to XXXX .

              "18582  Prior to making some overseas trips, I consulted the chase.com website to determine if my credit card had foreign transaction fees. \\n\\nI logged into the secure section of the website to ensure I was accessing my information, and under my credit card account, under the things you can do area, the first item was view my card benefits. When clicking on that, I was taken to a page ( I have the screen shots taken afterward ) that clearly states that there were no foreign transaction fees. \\n\\nAfter using this card for purchases on my trips, I was charged secure transaction fees totaling about {$40.00} US Dollars. I have two other cards that also do n't have these fees that I could easily have used. \\n\\nI have since been working directly with Chase, via their secure message system, to reverse these charges. They refuse to acknowledge that their website directs me to this page ( which i have screenshots that it does ) and they claim that the agreement I signed calls for these fees. I asked for a copy of my agreement - they said they do n't have it because I filled out my application online. I have all of these messages. \\n\\nI asked for a payoff balance so that I could close the card and they refused to provide it. I have these messages as well. \\n\\nI would like help in forcing them to close my account, and ideally, to refund these foreign transaction fees, that they are falsely advertising on this card. \\n\\nDespite this, after several secure message exchanges with Chase, they res with Chase                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

Unfortunately, weve confirmed that our mortgage is significantly underwater and amount of the underlying loan is much more than we could ever sell our home for. \\n\\nIn fact our loan is so far underwater which it will likely be years before it regains its prior value, After evaluating all of our foreclosure alternatives, weve concluded that due and our XXXX and health condition which is a huge burden, the only way to salvage and protect our only residence is through a loan modification.

              "7357   Dear sir, Reference my complaint no.XXXX dated XXXX against Chase Bank XXXX The bank had then submitted their reply which was vague and unsatisfactory. The bank used wrong account number to deceive and misguide so they can not be held responsible for releasing my inherited fund. They made it spiral and the report they had submitted was not accurate but flimsy. I had a time period of 30 days to submit my feedback but I did not submit any feed back and waited in the hope that the bank perhaps resubmit their clear report on my fund complaint. Eventually the time period of 30 days was passed but I did not see any changed report from them in the account. Some seven or eight months ago the Chase bank contacted me on my email saying that they could not come up with accurate and genuine position of my fund account because the bank had not get the fund register with the Federal Reserve so they wanted to send me my fund through a diplomatic means. I objected on this option and reiterated to let me have access my inherited fund account after activating which would have become dormant but they did not agree and again said to send XXXX dollar for a new account in my name to operate my inherited fund. \\n\\nI have all the documents and Chase Bank account statement when you will ask I will produce before you. My fund account statement bearing the account number was not mentioned in the report they had submitted to you. I have been since making request to the bank and to their CEO and Executive office. I am sorry to say that their Executive office have so far been negative and uncooperative and very active harassing me by far. \\n\\nI would very humbly request you to kindly intervene the matter again helping me to get access to my fund {$9.00} XXXX. \\n\\nThank you very much in anticipation. \\n\\nBest regards, XXXX XXXX                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
              "14599  I have been a customer at J.P. Morgan Chase for many years. \\nI closed some money market accounts I had in trust for clients. I received a letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2016 indicating they have decided to close my personal money market account at the bank. \\nThey indicated after a recent review of my account they decided to end our relationship. The account has always had a positive balance and I deposited my social security and small pension into the account each month as well as other funds. \\nI continue to have a business checking and my trust account for my office with them. I do n't understand how the relationship can be ended without any reason being given. It seems it was up to me to close the account and that they should not be able to close an account without a reason being given to the depositor. I called the number given to me in the letter and I was told that they could not offer a reason and that it was just too bad. Clearly the bank can not do do this without a valid reason.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

Nevertheless we were met with negligence and letter of 30 days notice to foreclose. \\n\\nWeve also spoken with several realtors who conducted research to determine the value of our home. Unfortunately, weve confirmed that our mortgage is significantly underwater and amount of the underlying loan is much more than we could ever sell our home for. \\n\\nIn fact our loan is so far underwater which it will likely be years before it regains its prior value, After evaluating all of our foreclosure alternatives, weve concluded that due and our XXXX and health condition which is a huge burden, the only way to salvage and protect our only residence is through a loan modification. This option allows us to stay in our home for years to come while avoiding the time and expense of a foreclosure lawsuit. \\n\\nBased on the underwater status of our mortgage, and our incompetency of affordability and our sever XXXX, reducing the principal amount of our loan is the fairest way to reduce payments. If necessary, we can look at a combination of reducing the principal and adjusting the interest rate or length of the loan to facilitate reduced payments which is our immediate goal and will be highly appreciated. \\n\\nAs you know, time is of the essence so please contact me as soon as possible to discuss available options and of course let us know if you need any additional information. \\nThanks in advance for your anticipated cooperation. \\nI contactcted the bank many times to help with loan modification untill this date no help, please i am asking for help i do not want to be in the street with my chlidrens Sincerely,</td>\n",

              "3  On XX/XX/2018, while trying to book a XXXX  XXXX  ticket, I came across an offer for {$300.00} to be applied towards the ticket if I applied for a rewards card. I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.</td>\n",

              "0   Good morning my name is XXXX XXXX and I appreciate it if you could help me put a stop to Chase Bank cardmember services. \\nIn 2018 I wrote to Chase asking for debt verification and what they sent me a statement which is not acceptable. I am asking the bank to validate the debt. Instead I been receiving mail every month from them attempting to collect a debt. \\nI have a right to know this information as a consumer. \\n\\nChase account # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Thanks in advance

              "6   With out notice J.P. Morgan Chase restricted my account by my debit card Tuesday XX/XX/2019. On Thursday XX/XX/2019 I went into A branch after being advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed. I went into the branch to see how I can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned. The bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would Post but they may take an additional business day. That Saturday I attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on Friday, XX/XX/2019. Upon looking at my account I realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement. Ive been called and I was told that it may take two business day stating Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only. Now, Chase is informing me that I will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently. Unfortunately, This has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments, etc. I am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that I have peace of mind in fact Chase has handled my situation grossly I even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself. Although I know that Chase reserves the right to close my account at any time I do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document.

This situation is truly affecting my livelihood and they dont seem to want to deal with Me professionally.

              "12  I opened an account with chase bank on XXXX and used a code for XXXX bonus. I called to follow up on XX/XX/XXXX about the terms and was told everything was on the account and once I made XXXX direct deposit the bonus would be paid out in 10 days. As of XXXX I had made the required deposits and was told my account never had the coupon code applied and it was past the 21 days to do so, so no bonus would be paid.

              "3   On XX/XX/2018, while trying to book a XXXX  XXXX  ticket, I came across an offer for {$300.00} to be applied towards the ticket if I applied for a rewards card. I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.

              "47  I am XXXX military member ( XXXX ) with the XXXX. Chase Auto Finance is refusing to pay on the GAP insurance/waiver coverage that I purchased at the time I signed the financing agreement. While stationed at XXXX I purchased a XXXX Cadillac ATS Premium and financed the vehicle with Chase Auto Finance. When I purchased the vehicle the original financing agreement included an option to purchase GAP insurance for an additional {$690.00}. The provider of the GAP insurance was \" XXXX XXXX '' however I was also required to sign a GAP Waiver Addendum which stated that what was purchased was not insurance, but an agreement for Chase Auto Finance to Waive any deficiency in the event the vehicle was totaled. Chase Auto Finance agreed in writing for me to ship my vehicle to XXXX when I received military orders re-assigning me to XXXX. The letter explicitly authorized me to drive the vehicle here in XXXX while I am stationed overseas. The vehicle was totaled in an accident. Now Chase is refusing to honor the GAP insurance/waiver provisions because the loss occurred outside of the United States or XXXX. They are also refusing to release the lien on the vehicle so that the salvage value can be recovered and sent to the bank. I simply want Chase Bank to honor its commitment to cover the deficiency between the insurance payout and the remaining balance on the loan ( {$1300.00} if the salvage value of {$8000.00} is paid ).

              "14  My chase amazon card was declined for a catering order I had placed for my brothers funeral in the amount of {$710.00}. I contacted chase around noon today XX/XX/2019 and was asked the last 4 numbers of my chase savings account and the other user on my account. I responded that I did not have a savings and I am only authorized user. Customer rep told me they would call me back in 10 minutes to keep the line open. I didnt receive a call back after an hour so I contacted chase. From the first call I thought someone was using my card fraudulently. I spoke to the rep who transferred me to a supervisor XXXX who said the card was activated and the transaction would process. Called the catering company and card was declined. I then used my XXXX  XXXX card to pay for the order. XXXX XXXX texted me asking if I was authorizing purchase and I responded yes. Contacted caterer and XXXX  XXXX was declined. I contacted chase again spoke to rep was told the initial questions are used to trick people to see what there answer would be. She told me the CVV code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and I responded that I had gone over the numbers and CVV used was correct. She told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for 24 hours. Called caterer - card declined. Use a MasterCard  which processed. Went to use chase amazon at restaurant at XXXX pm tonight in the amount of {$63.00} - it was declined. I was told by chase I was not over limit. Still frustrated figuring out multiple declines after several conversations with chase stating the card would be ok to use. Embarrassed as the caterer kept suggesting I was over my limit which I pay my card in full every month and chase confirmed that I was under my limit with the {$710.00} transaction. Never been declined by either chase or XXXX  XXXX before - today after multiple assurances that I was all set and card would be monitored to make sure transaction would clear - it never did                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
              "8   On XXXX XX/XX/2019, I made a {$300.00} payment to an online retailer using Chase quick pay with XXXX on the Chase website. I realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation, product, or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted Chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank. \\n\\nI contacted Chase via a secured message on XX/XX/2019 explaining what happened and asked \" Is there a way to reverse this transaction, or do you have a contact at XXXX that can give me more information about the recipient? '' That XXXX, my message was reviewed and I received a response restating my original email and informing me that \" The transfer has been completed. However, as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email, some require the expertise of another team. In order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our Consumer Online Technical Support Team. '' I called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department. I was directed to call XXXX and ask them about the transaction because Chase did not have any information outside of what I provided when initiating the transfer. I felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and I had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at XXXX and didn't have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask XXXX or what words and phrases I should use to get the information I was looking for. \\n\\nI called XXXX who's automated system initially directed me to call my bank because I used the banks app to initiate the transaction. I called XXXX again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent. They told me that all of the information about the transaction would in Chase 's system because I used the banks app to perform the transaction. She stayed on the line with me until I understood everything that I should ask and had a better understanding of the situation. I ended the call and called chase again. \\n\\nWhen I called chase the second time, the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information. She then asked me why I needed this information and I explained my situation again. I was once again transferred to the claims department, who told me that I needed to contact XXXX to get the information I was looking for. After I told her that I had already contacted them, she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured. She said that Chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that I inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system. In both phone calls, they asked if I initiated that transaction, and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter. \\n\\nDuring this whole process, it felt like Chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation. These transactions are advertised as a \" fast, safe and easy way to send money, '' but seem to be a dangerous way to do business. I feel deceived by Chase 's advertising and further victimized by the way I was treated by the members on their customer service team.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
              "19  I made a purchase with XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2019 in the amount of {$38.00}. I was charged twice for this transaction. I placed a disputes case with Chase bank on XX/XX/2019 when I noticed the charge on my account. I called back on Sunday, XX/XX/2019 about the provisional credit for the charge and again on Monday, XX/XX/2019. I was told the charge had to post before a provisional credit could be provided. I used my debt card on Monday, XX/XX/2019 then tried to use it again but it would not work. I went to Chase bank on XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, Nevada and was told that my account was closed due to fraudulent activity. I was shocked because I had not reported fraud on my account. I later found out that I was being accused by the disputes department of placing a fraudulent disputes case for the duplicate charge from XXXX XXXX  XXXX. I later contacted XXXX XXXX  XXXX again and was told that they DID see a duplicate charge and would credit my account within 3 - 5  days. I contacted the chase disputes department again on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. 2019 and explained thaXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX would credit my account and that I did not like being accused of making a fraudulent disputes claim. The escalation manager did NOT care and told me that Chase decision on closing my account was final. I had been a customer of Chase for XXXX   years. My character has been challenged by the disputes agents and I consider this to be detrimental to my character and slander. \\n\\nI am NOT seeking to keep my account open with Chase BUT I also do NOT want Chase reporting that they closed my checking account involuntarily. \\n\\nOnce again, I do NOT want Chase to have the checking account that I had with them being reflecting on any public records as being closed as involuntary closure by Chase. \\n\\nI did nothing wrong by filing a disputes claim for the duplicate charge or any other disputes cases that were filed in the past.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
              "24  I made a purchase of {$260.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I made payments of {$160.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and {$260.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. The minimum payment was {$140.00}. The closing date was XX/XX/XXXX ( please see attached statement ). That statement ( XX/XX/XXXX ) shows that I had an outstanding purchase balance of {$230.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were NO other purchases prior to the one on XX/XX/XXXX. \\nHowever, when I got the XXXX statement, it shows that I still have a purchase balance of {$210.00}. I have a promotional balance (@XXXX ) in XXXX of {$6900.00}. In XXXX, the promotional balance was {$7200.00} - a difference of {$380.00}. \\n\\nApparently, the payment ( above the minimum payment required by Chase ) I thought would be applied to the purchase (@ 21.49 % ) was applied to the promotional balance first. It is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met, payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first. This is not the first time that Chase has skirted US Financial Law to turn a larger profit. I need help in rectifying this problem, because my logic fell on deaf ears at Chase. Thank you in advance for your assistance. \\n\\nRespectfully, XXXX XXXX XXXX

It was then found that my debit card had been use to make multiple transactions totaling {$2800.00} between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX Actions I Have Personally Taken To Resolve The Issue XX/XX/XXXX After beginning to receive claims paperwork, I immediately notified Chase claims department. The first claims specialist I spoke with was very rude. She kept badgering me about the final transaction on my account. When I couldn't provide her the information, she to call me back when I had the proper information and hung up. I called back and spoke with a guy named XXXX. I explained the situation to XXXX. He had me verify my last know transaction. After verifying my last known transaction, XXXX took a look at the claims made from XX/XX/XXXX. I advised XXXX that these were claims that I did not call in to reverse. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX This was the 2nd call I would make in 48 hours. The claim 's specialist, once again, was very rude. When I called back, I told the claim 's specialist I would like to speak to a supervisor. I was put on hold for 15 minutes. I finally became frustrated and hung up. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX This was the 3rd attempt made to ( attempt to ) get help in recovering my money. To get any answers, I had to use a potential review to the XXXX XXXX XXXX about Chase 's claims practices and protocols. I was then transferred to Chase 's Executive Office to escalate my claim. It was at the Executive Office that I spoke with XXXX. XXXX opened Claim XXXX on my behalf. She said once my claim was assigned to an Executive Office employee, that person would contact me at the number on file. \\n\\nXXXX - Mid XXXX My case was assigned to XXXX in the Executive office. We spent roughly 2 weeks before either one of us spoke on the phone - although she had left a handful of voicemails. I first spoke with XXXX on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX. I told her about the multiple claims that were opened against an account I had since closed. She claimed she only received two of the claims against the account. After speaking with me she assured me she was going to \" investigate '' all the claims made that were made beginning at the end of XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed multiple payments being deducted from my Chase checking account. In the description, all I saw were numbers. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX to see why money was being debited from my account. Of course, all I got was XXXX 's voicemail. I left a message requesting a return call. By XX/XX/XXXX, I still had not received a return call. I called XXXX once again because money was still being debited from my account. This time I got a hold of XXXX. Her explanation for the debited funds was a bit odd. She told me that while they were \" investigating '' these open claims, money was still going to be debited and there was nothing she could do about it. Finally, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a voicemail from XXXX to call her as soon as possible. I returned her call once school was dismissed for the day. It was at that point, that XXXX told me they closed their \" investigation '' of my claims and decided not to reverse their decision. When asked what research they used to complete their \" investigation '' XXXX became short and told me I would have to subpoena the information. At that point, I hung up because I felt that it was a lose lose situation.   \n",
              "33  I recently called to ask Chase bank why they reported to the credit Bureau that I was 30 days late on a payment that was already paid off. When I called I got this info : They showed that on the XXXX of XX/XX/2019 I was very late on my bill and owed XXXX to bring this balance down to XXXX and be finished with the bill. I paid that amount on the same day the XXXX to being it to XXXX. \\n\\nTHey say that I tried to make another payment for {$250.00} later that same day and in a few days that came back as a return payment. \\n\\nThe man on the phone stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that I had a credit on my account for XXXX since I didnt owe anything. \\n\\nThey updated my account with charges and late fees from the return payment that I had no idea of since I thought I paid off the entire amount. They reported to the credit Bureau that I was 30 days late for not paying what accrued to be {$56.00} The guy representing Chase agreed with me that they were in the wrong for charging me the fees and said they would remove them. I still have {$2.00} in the negative that they are saying that i owe in the mobile app. \\n\\nAdditionally, because they reported me being late my credit score dropped 51 points. When I called back to ask if they can report that they made a mistake they said I would have to do that on my own. I think that's XXXX.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
              "7   During the summer months, I experience a decline income due to my employment. Therefore, I request a one month payment extension with my Auto Loan Company, Chase. For the past almost fours years, my request for payment extension is granted. I have never been delinquent with my auto loan payment. However, On XX/XX/2019 my request for a one month payment extension was denied this year. I explained my situation to representative and the supervisor with no avail. After a lengthy discussion and waiting, I was informed the reason for the decline as it is not \" contractual ''. This reason for denial baffled me and therefore I emailed the office of XXXX XXXX Executive Director, Communications, JPMorgan Chase & Co. A representative contacted me and stated Chase will follow-up. About week later a representative of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX office called. The representative shared her role was help resolve the matter. The representative via conference call contacted the department handing my request. After, reviewing my information my request was still denied based on \" policy changes ''. I requested an explanation and representative stated a letter will be mailed with explanation. I have received XXXX letters the reason for denial was not \" policy changes ''. I would like CFPB help in exploring the denial of my payment extension request especially since I have been clear reason for denial.

On Thursday XX/XX/2019 I went into A branch after being advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed. I went into the branch to see how I can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned. The bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would Post but they may take an additional business day. That Saturday I attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on Friday, XX/XX/2019. Upon looking at my account I realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement. Ive been called and I was told that it may take two business day stating Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only. Now, Chase is informing me that I will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently. Unfortunately, This has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments, etc. I am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that I have peace of mind in fact Chase has handled my situation grossly I even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself. Although I know that Chase reserves the right to close my account at any time I do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document.

I responded that I did not have a savings and I am only authorized user. Customer rep told me they would call me back in 10 minutes to keep the line open. I didnt receive a call back after an hour so I contacted chase. From the first call I thought someone was using my card fraudulently. I spoke to the rep who transferred me to a supervisor XXXX who said the card was activated and the transaction would process. Called the catering company and card was declined. I then used my XXXX  XXXX card to pay for the order. XXXX XXXX texted me asking if I was authorizing purchase and I responded yes. Contacted caterer and XXXX  XXXX was declined. I contacted chase again spoke to rep was told the initial questions are used to trick people to see what there answer would be. She told me the CVV code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and I responded that I had gone over the numbers and CVV used was correct. She told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for 24 hours. Called caterer - card declined. Use a MasterCard  which processed. Went to use chase amazon at restaurant at XXXX pm tonight in the amount of {$63.00} - it was declined. I was told by chase I was not over limit. Still frustrated figuring out multiple declines after several conversations with chase stating the card would be ok to use.

I realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation, product, or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted Chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank. \\n\\nI contacted Chase via a secured message on XX/XX/2019 explaining what happened and asked \" Is there a way to reverse this transaction, or do you have a contact at XXXX that can give me more information about the recipient? '' That XXXX, my message was reviewed and I received a response restating my original email and informing me that \" The transfer has been completed. However, as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email, some require the expertise of another team. In order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our Consumer Online Technical Support Team. '' I called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department. I was directed to call XXXX and ask them about the transaction because Chase did not have any information outside of what I provided when initiating the transfer. I felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and I had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at XXXX and didn't have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask XXXX or what words and phrases I should use to get the information I was looking for. \\n\\nI called XXXX who's automated system initially directed me to call my bank because I used the banks app to initiate the transaction. I called XXXX again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent. They told me that all of the information about the transaction would in Chase 's system because I used the banks app to perform the transaction. She stayed on the line with me until I understood everything that I should ask and had a better understanding of the situation. I ended the call and called chase again. \\n\\nWhen I called chase the second time, the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information. She then asked me why I needed this information and I explained my situation again. I was once again transferred to the claims department, who told me that I needed to contact XXXX to get the information I was looking for. After I told her that I had already contacted them, she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured. She said that Chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that I inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system. In both phone calls, they asked if I initiated that transaction, and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter. \\n\\nDuring this whole process, it felt like Chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation. These transactions are advertised as a \" fast, safe and easy way to send money, '' but seem to be a dangerous way to do business. I feel deceived by Chase 's advertising and further victimized by the way I was treated by the members on their customer service team.</td>\n",

The closing date was XX/XX/XXXX ( please see attached statement ). That statement ( XX/XX/XXXX ) shows that I had an outstanding purchase balance of {$230.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were NO other purchases prior to the one on XX/XX/XXXX. \\nHowever, when I got the XXXX statement, it shows that I still have a purchase balance of {$210.00}. I have a promotional balance (@XXXX ) in XXXX of {$6900.00}. In XXXX, the promotional balance was {$7200.00} - a difference of {$380.00}. \\n\\nApparently, the payment ( above the minimum payment required by Chase ) I thought would be applied to the purchase (@ 21.49 % ) was applied to the promotional balance first. It is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met, payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first. This is not the first time that Chase has skirted US Financial Law to turn a larger profit. I need help in rectifying this problem, because my logic fell on deaf ears at Chase.

Finally, a payment was reversed from XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$230.00}. \\nXX/XX/XXXX Claim # : XXXX I made a claim in the branch that was advised by a customer service representative. \\nThis advice was made when I went to close out an account after receiving a phishing email. It was then found that my debit card had been use to make multiple transactions totaling {$2800.00} between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX Actions I Have Personally Taken To Resolve The Issue XX/XX/XXXX After beginning to receive claims paperwork, I immediately notified Chase claims department. The first claims specialist I spoke with was very rude. She kept badgering me about the final transaction on my account. When I couldn't provide her the information, she to call me back when I had the proper information and hung up. I called back and spoke with a guy named XXXX. I explained the situation to XXXX. He had me verify my last know transaction. After verifying my last known transaction, XXXX took a look at the claims made from XX/XX/XXXX. I advised XXXX that these were claims that I did not call in to reverse. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX This was the 2nd call I would make in 48 hours. The claim 's specialist, once again, was very rude. When I called back, I told the claim 's specialist I would like to speak to a supervisor. I was put on hold for 15 minutes. I finally became frustrated and hung up. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX This was the 3rd attempt made to ( attempt to ) get help in recovering my money. To get any answers, I had to use a potential review to the XXXX XXXX XXXX about Chase 's claims practices and protocols. I was then transferred to Chase 's Executive Office to escalate my claim. It was at the Executive Office that I spoke with XXXX. XXXX opened Claim XXXX on my behalf. She said once my claim was assigned to an Executive Office employee, that person would contact me at the number on file. \\n\\nXXXX - Mid XXXX My case was assigned to XXXX in the Executive office. We spent roughly 2 weeks before either one of us spoke on the phone - although she had left a handful of voicemails. I first spoke with XXXX on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX. I told her about the multiple claims that were opened against an account I had since closed. She claimed she only received two of the claims against the account. After speaking with me she assured me she was going to \" investigate '' all the claims made that were made beginning at the end of XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed multiple payments being deducted from my Chase checking account. In the description, all I saw were numbers. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX to see why money was being debited from my account. Of course, all I got was XXXX 's voicemail. I left a message requesting a return call. By XX/XX/XXXX, I still had not received a return call. I called XXXX once again because money was still being debited from my account. This time I got a hold of XXXX. Her explanation for the debited funds was a bit odd. She told me that while they were \" investigating '' these open claims, money was still going to be debited and there was nothing she could do about it. Finally, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a voicemail from XXXX to call her as soon as possible. I returned her call once school was dismissed for the day. It was at that point, that XXXX told me they closed their \" investigation '' of my claims and decided not to reverse their decision. When asked what research they used to complete their \" investigation '' XXXX became short and told me I would have to subpoena the information. At that point, I hung up because I felt that it was a lose lose situation.</td>\n",

              "3  On XX/XX/2018, while trying to book a XXXX  XXXX  ticket, I came across an offer for {$300.00} to be applied towards the ticket if I applied for a rewards card. I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.</td>\n",

Instead I been receiving mail every month from them attempting to collect a debt. \\nI have a right to know this information as a consumer. \\n\\nChase account # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Thanks in advance for your help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

              "3  On XX/XX/2018, while trying to book a XXXX  XXXX  ticket, I came across an offer for {$300.00} to be applied towards the ticket if I applied for a rewards card. I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018.

              "1426   My husband and I had a joint checking account with Chase Bank for over 20 years. \\nThe account was opened while we lived in the XXXX area. After moving to XXXX XXXX XXXX years ago, we opened new bank accounts with a local bank because Chase did not have branches in XXXX XXXX. We had an automatic monthly life insurance premium deducted from the Chase account and automatic monthly deposits for my husband 's small pensions. We accessed this account infrequently because there was no need to. It was simply easier to leave this account in place than close it and change the automatic deduction/deposits. \\n\\nIn early XX/XX/XXXX my husband noticed that XXXX separate withdrawals had occurred, XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$790.00} and XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$1500.00}, neither of which we authorized. My husband contacted Chase to report the theft and was told someone would look into it, and in the meantime, a temporary credit would be issued. A few days later in XX/XX/XXXX while talking again with Chase, my husband was told two additional withdrawals had occurred, {$1.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and {$1500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. My husband had been told by Chase that amounts taken fraudulently and reported within 60 days would be reimbursed. \\n\\nWhile reviewing our Chase account yesterday, we noticed that {$1.00}, {$790.00}, and {$1500.00} had been reimbursed in our account, but the {$1500.00} taken in XX/XX/XXXX had not. The theft of {$1500.00} had been reported on XX/XX/XXXX, 52 days after it had occurred, within the 60 day window. \\n\\nI called Chase XX/XX/XXXX to ask about the un-reimbursed {$1500.00} and, incredibly, was told the 60 day window started with the first theft that occurred in XX/XX/XXXX. That the thief was clever enough to withdraw the unnoticeable amount of {$1.00} and wait another three months before withdrawing fraudulently again, it was, according to Chase, our misfortune that the 60 day window had passed. \\n\\nWe depend on our bank to safeguard our assets and not simply give our money to anyone who asks. We also expect our bank to reimburse for fraudulent activity when reported promptly. Chase 's 60-day window that starts with the first occurrence is arbitrary and harmful to it's customers. My husband was told that after an incidence of fraud is reported, the bank will neither investigate further fraudulent activity nor reimburse the loss ( es ) resulting from fraud. In other words, a thief who repeatedly accesses an account will simply be allowed to do so at a Chase bank. \\n\\nIn our case, we were victims twice - the first by the unknown person who accessed our account, and by Chase, who has refused to reimburse us for the {$1500.00} loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
              "14289  On XX/XX/2016 my home was sold unlawfully at a Sheriff 's sale by HSBC Bank USA , National Association, as Indenture Trustee, of the XXXX Securitization Trust XXXX Callable Mortgage-Backed Notes, Series XXXX The foreclosure sale was illegally authorized by HSBC Bank USA and XXXX before the loss mitigation process was completed. Employees of XXXX have admitted verbally that there is no proof that the foreclosure should have taken place since the loss mitigation process was not completed. I was assigned a single point of contact ( SPOC ) at XXXX to manage the loss mitigation process since I was unemployed and recently started my own company to earn income to support a loan modification plan. Prior to the sale of the home, XXXX assigned a new SPOC, but the home was sold prior to initiating a discussion with this person. I submitted all required information to XXXX to support the loss mitigation process and was told that I would be informed of the decision. This was never done. To date, no decision was reached regarding the loss mitigation evaluation process and I told that the loss mitigation request was in review and no decision was made. Prior to the sale of the home, the lender, HSBC, was working with a local law firm to sell the home and kept issuing new documents that the foreclosure sale would occur on a particular date while the customer service division of XXXX was working with me on a loss mitigation plan to avoid the foreclosure sale. I believe this process is called \" dual tracking '' and is illegal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
              "14279  XXXX XXXX, XXXX I am writing you to investigate my concerns of becoming the latest victim of predatory Private student loans by JPMorgan Chase. ( Which is/was serviced by XXXX ). I took out these loan is XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX during the time of the Mortgage Crisis. Not knowing there would be no repayments option for consumers that might have financial hardship. The loans were presented to me as an unsecured loan and at that time I received from Chase directly XXXX checks of $ XXXX each that I was able to deposit in my account. Fast forward one of the loans became due XXXX XXXX. I made full payments each month when the XXXX loan became due. Sometimes I would make both payments after the due date however is was becoming increasingly difficult to keep up. However, I still maintaining payment each month with the assistance of getting forbearance in XX/XX/XXXX. It was becoming difficult to maintain payment of $ XXXX month.I called XXXX and told them I was having some financial hardship because I was hospitalized in XXXX XXXX, l started falling behind on my payments XX/XX/XXXX. At that time I had asked if I could get a forbearance which I had received in the once before and was told I was not eligible and that there were not her options for me but to make payments. XX/XX/XXXX I made a payment of of {$200.00}. Which now XXXX loans were being serviced by XXXX. In XXXX XXXX, I resumed full payments on both loans. In XXXX XXXX, I was hospitalized and continued to make regular payments until XXXX XXXX. This resulted in a hardship for me not only do I have these student loans, I 'm bombarded with a lot of medical expenses. I requested numerous times to see if they could combine my loans into one monthly payment because of my hardship. I was consistently told the lender Chase did not offer any repayment options. I question their method of combining XXXX loans into XXXX account but that did not allow me to make XXXX monthly payment for both. In XXXX XXXX, I advised XXXX I would not be able to meet my monthly obligation, they continued to tell me I had no other options but to pay. I could not pay the regular monthly payments but continued to make good faith payments of {$100.00} each on XXXX loans starting in XX/XX/XXXX up until XXXX XXXX, so I thought. XXXX XXXX, I went on XXXX website to make a {$100.00} and realized that XXXX of the loans went into default and was not allowed to make payments because I was blocked on the website. On XXXX XXXX I spoke with several representatives that told me the {$100.00} payments I was making went to XXXX account in which I thought was going towards both accounts. This resulted XXXX of the loans going in default. The representative told me if they were to reverse the payments will result in both of loans going into default. This is clearly a UDAAP violation. This has resulted in personal financial injury to me. My credit has now plummeted from XXXX to XXXX. My credit now is completely ruined. This could have all been avoided if XXXX/Chase would have worked with me to give options to make reasonable arrangements. This predatory loan is designed for financial failure. I never been in a situation like this before in my and never had bad credit until now. Every debt of mine is update except these student loans. I believe in paying my bills. I know I owe the debt and want to make it right I just ask that they work with me to accomplish this. I can not afford to make full payments at this time. XXXX told me the loan was sent back to Chase for further action. I called Chase and got the run around. I spoke with XXXX different representatives and was told to call back in 2 weeks. No one from Chase will talk to me now. I do not want my wages garnished just need help. I have a Federal Student loan that is coming due in XX/XX/XXXX this will only add to more finance   \n",

              "813    About a year ago I started contacting Chase bank about a year ago. I had found out that there had been a checking and savings account opended up under my name. I went through the dispute process with Chase. They told me at the end of the investigation that If they found enough information that the account was not mine, they would be able to remove it from my credit reports, XXXX etc and then I would be able to open an account with them Fast forward after months of phne calls and emails with them. Turned out they did not hold me at fault for the account, but then back tracked that I could not be able to open an account with them. Also, I had reported to them that there was a chase credit card that was also opened up fraudluently under my name. I still have no heard anything back on that. I would like to be able to open an account with Chase like promised, and also would like to know what is going on with this credit card that I did not open.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

              "      <td>My husband and I had a joint checking account with Chase Bank for over 20 years. \\nThe account was opened while we lived in the XXXX area. After moving to XXXX XXXX XXXX years ago, we opened new bank accounts with a local bank because Chase did not have branches in XXXX XXXX. We had an automatic monthly life insurance premium deducted from the Chase account and automatic monthly deposits for my husband 's small pensions. We accessed this account infrequently because there was no need to. It was simply easier to leave this account in place than close it and change the automatic deduction/deposits. \\n\\nIn early XX/XX/XXXX my husband noticed that XXXX separate withdrawals had occurred, XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$790.00} and XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$1500.00}, neither of which we authorized. My husband contacted Chase to report the theft and was told someone would look into it, and in the meantime, a temporary credit would be issued. A few days later in XX/XX/XXXX while talking again with Chase, my husband was told two additional withdrawals had occurred, {$1.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and {$1500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. My husband had been told by Chase that amounts taken fraudulently and reported within 60 days would be reimbursed. \\n\\nWhile reviewing our Chase account yesterday, we noticed that {$1.00}, {$790.00}, and {$1500.00} had been reimbursed in our account, but the {$1500.00} taken in XX/XX/XXXX had not. The theft of {$1500.00} had been reported on XX/XX/XXXX, 52 days after it had occurred, within the 60 day window. \\n\\nI called Chase XX/XX/XXXX to ask about the un-reimbursed {$1500.00} and, incredibly, was told the 60 day window started with the first theft that occurred in XX/XX/XXXX. That the thief was clever enough to withdraw the unnoticeable amount of {$1.00} and wait another three months before withdrawing fraudulently again, it was, according to Chase, our misfortune that the 60 day window had passed. \\n\\nWe depend on our bank to safeguard our assets and not simply give our money to anyone who asks. We also expect our bank to reimburse for fraudulent activity when reported promptly. Chase 's 60-day window that starts with the first occurrence is arbitrary and harmful to it's customers. My husband was told that after an incidence of fraud is reported, the bank will neither investigate further fraudulent activity nor reimburse the loss ( es ) resulting from fraud. In other words, a thief who repeatedly accesses an account will simply be allowed to do so at a Chase bank. \\n\\nIn our case, we were victims twice - the first by the unknown person who accessed our account, and by Chase, who has refused to reimburse us for the {$1500.00} loss.</td>\n",

Employees of XXXX have admitted verbally that there is no proof that the foreclosure should have taken place since the loss mitigation process was not completed. I was assigned a single point of contact ( SPOC ) at XXXX to manage the loss mitigation process since I was unemployed and recently started my own company to earn income to support a loan modification plan. Prior to the sale of the home, XXXX assigned a new SPOC, but the home was sold prior to initiating a discussion with this person. I submitted all required information to XXXX to support the loss mitigation process and was told that I would be informed of the decision. This was never done. To date, no decision was reached regarding the loss mitigation evaluation process and I told that the loss mitigation request was in review and no decision was made. Prior to the sale of the home, the lender, HSBC, was working with a local law firm to sell the home and kept issuing new documents that the foreclosure sale would occur on a particular date while the customer service division of XXXX was working with me on a loss mitigation plan to avoid the foreclosure sale. I believe this process is called \" dual tracking '' and is illegal.</td>\n",

              "      <td>XXXX XXXX, XXXX I am writing you to investigate my concerns of becoming the latest victim of predatory Private student loans by JPMorgan Chase. ( Which is/was serviced by XXXX ). I took out these loan is XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX during the time of the Mortgage Crisis. Not knowing there would be no repayments option for consumers that might have financial hardship. The loans were presented to me as an unsecured loan and at that time I received from Chase directly XXXX checks of $ XXXX each that I was able to deposit in my account. Fast forward one of the loans became due XXXX XXXX. I made full payments each month when the XXXX loan became due. Sometimes I would make both payments after the due date however is was becoming increasingly difficult to keep up. However, I still maintaining payment each month with the assistance of getting forbearance in XX/XX/XXXX. It was becoming difficult to maintain payment of $ XXXX month.I called XXXX and told them I was having some financial hardship because I was hospitalized in XXXX XXXX, l started falling behind on my payments XX/XX/XXXX. At that time I had asked if I could get a forbearance which I had received in the once before and was told I was not eligible and that there were not her options for me but to make payments. XX/XX/XXXX I made a payment of of {$200.00}. Which now XXXX loans were being serviced by XXXX. In XXXX XXXX, I resumed full payments on both loans. In XXXX XXXX, I was hospitalized and continued to make regular payments until XXXX XXXX. This resulted in a hardship for me not only do I have these student loans, I 'm bombarded with a lot of medical expenses. I requested numerous times to see if they could combine my loans into one monthly payment because of my hardship. I was consistently told the lender Chase did not offer any repayment options. I question their method of combining XXXX loans into XXXX account but that did not allow me to make XXXX monthly payment for both. In XXXX XXXX, I advised XXXX I would not be able to meet my monthly obligation, they continued to tell me I had no other options but to pay. I could not pay the regular monthly payments but continued to make good faith payments of {$100.00} each on XXXX loans starting in XX/XX/XXXX up until XXXX XXXX, so I thought. XXXX XXXX, I went on XXXX website to make a {$100.00} and realized that XXXX of the loans went into default and was not allowed to make payments because I was blocked on the website. On XXXX XXXX I spoke with several representatives that told me the {$100.00} payments I was making went to XXXX account in which I thought was going towards both accounts. This resulted XXXX of the loans going in default. The representative told me if they were to reverse the payments will result in both of loans going into default. This is clearly a UDAAP violation. This has resulted in personal financial injury to me. My credit has now plummeted from XXXX to XXXX. My credit now is completely ruined. This could have all been avoided if XXXX/Chase would have worked with me to give options to make reasonable arrangements. This predatory loan is designed for financial failure. I never been in a situation like this before in my and never had bad credit until now. Every debt of mine is update except these student loans. I believe in paying my bills. I know I owe the debt and want to make it right I just ask that they work with me to accomplish this. I can not afford to make full payments at this time. XXXX told me the loan was sent back to Chase for further action. I called Chase and got the run around. I spoke with XXXX different representatives and was told to call back in 2 weeks. No one from Chase will talk to me now. I do not want my wages garnished just need help. I have a Federal Student loan that is coming due in XX/XX/XXXX this will only add to more finance</td>\n",
